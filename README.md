# Linked Lists

Complete the LinkedList.java class. You may use the code found on pages 454 to 466 to help.

### NOTE
The text gives an example of a linked list of int type data. This app requires you to adapt that code to String type data.

## Scenario
Assume that this app will use a linked list of names of students in a class. Each node is a student, and the data is the students name. You must develop methods to print the list, insert at the beginning of the list, insert at the end of the list, insert after a specified name, delete a name, and search.
